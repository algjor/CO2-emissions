# CO2-emissions
For this project we started with discussions on emissions as two of the three teammates work in relations to regulations & have newly assigned projects with CO2 & Emissions standards.
First, we were reviewing carbon footprint of some of the materials used to make leather seats vs. vegan leather which is made with synthetic polymers but could not find datasets that had enough information. We then found regulations of CO2 Emissions in Europe which are set to have a target of 93.6g/km until 2029 (15% reduction compared to the 2021 baseline), 49.5g/km from 2030 to 2034 (55% reduction) and 0g/km from 2035 (100% reduction). 
In these European Environmental Agency Guidelines: https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/co2-performance-of-new-passenger#:~:text=To%20help%20achieve%20the%20EU's,2035%20(100%25%20reduction). 

We then researched databases and found this one from the Environmental Agency which includes raw data for emissions / CO2 usage & also fuel usage for petrol & diesel vehicles in Europe model years 2018 to 2023. While we were reviewing the data and the dashboard we decided to also look at the average price of the vehicles in the dataset, curious if price would correlate to emissions standards. 
The Dataset with European car prices can be found in this dataset

Once we had both datasets we came up with these two problem statements we will try to solve:
1.	How likely “Real World – CO2 Emissions (g/KM) will be to the WLTP (World harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure) Standard in Europe for vehicles model year 2018 to 2023.
a.	Identify the Price Point (vehicle make & model) at which a vehicle’s CO2 Emissions (g/KM) is most beneficial for the environment by reviewing how price point of vehicle drives/influences CO2 Emissions.
